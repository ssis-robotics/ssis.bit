# ssis:bit hardware

The foundation of the ssis:bit is a [LilyGo T8 ST7789](https://circuitpython.org/board/lilygo_ttgo_t8_s2_st7789/) board with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/). It has already many key features out of the box:

- ESP32-S2 with 240 MHz CPU, 4GB Flash, 8GB PSRAM
- 1.14" ST7789 Display 240x135
- WIFI4 2.4 GHz
- microSD card slot for sensor data or images
- battery charging circuit, on/off power switch
- USB-C connector

To make it even easier and versatile to use we added a secondary PCB to add the following functionality:

- QWIIC I2C connector for sensors and other perepherial 
- 3 buttons as input (menu selector)
- 500 mAh battery in space between the PCBs
- MPU6050 accelerometer and magnetometer and temperature sensor

## v1.0 First official edition

Ordered at PCBway this is the first official PCB to share with our students.

## v0.2 3-way selector

We got some ... from Aliexpress and the protptype looks like this

## v0.1 first prototype

`2022-01-06`

The first boards arrived early January 2022 and this is the first soldered PCB with a 500 mAh battery:
